# homebudget-dashboard
A web dashboard for data from the "HomeBudget" expense tracker. 

HomeBudget is a set of expense management software for the home. Its available for Mac, Windows, iOS and Android. 

I was unsatisfied with the built in visualization in the iOS app, so I decided to make a web dashboard. You export the data using wifi, and the dashboard server will import it.
